I wanted to pursue a project related to medicine which would help the common public. I have used almost all the classification algorithms to predict if a person is diabetic or healthy from the dataset. 

Features:
**Pregnancies	
*Glucose	
*BloodPressure	
*SkinThickness	
*Insulin	
*BMI	
*DiabetesPedigreeFunction	
*Age	
*Outcome
